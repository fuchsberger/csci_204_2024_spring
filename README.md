# Class Material Repository

## Installation Requirements
You are going to need the following programs installed on your computer thorughtout the semester:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+
- Git [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/windows)) or [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (recommended) or another IDE with integrated Shell

## Syncing class material to your computer
You can clone this repository (requires git installed) by running the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuchsberger/csci_204_2024_spring.git
```
**_Note: The link above has been updated since class. Cloning should work now without having public key authentication set up._**

If you see this file apparing on your computer you have successfully synced the class materials.

In the future you can always get the latest class materials by running the following while inside this folder.

```bash
git pull
```

Note that this should remain a read-only place throghout the semester. While you technically can make any changes, you will be unable to sync and pull newer materials if you do so. If you by accident make changes to this repository and would like to dismiss them so you can sync again you can run:

```bash
git reset --hard
git pull
```

I do also recommending saving this folder as a workspace in VS Code.
Use a separate workspace for your coding related activities (including assignments)
