# Bubble Sort

- very similar to Selection sort but simpler (and less efficient)

### Idea
Swap consecuitive elements.
If we did at least one swap, repeat.

### Activity 3
See in-class card example / example on board then implement in small teams on whiteboard.


# Shell Sort
Please see Prof. Lee's slides for shell sort and some background on what we did so far:

### Activity 4
Implement in small teams on whiteboard according to the pseudo code in the slides.
